By default, the following 
characters have special meaning in patterns. Note that all of these can be 
changed through the use of the <TT>@set-syntax</TT> function. See also the 
<TT>-literal</TT> option. 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT><TT>*</TT>
  <DD>In a template, this denotes a wild-card argument that matches any number 
  of characters, from zero up to a maximum of 4096, or as specified by the 
  <TT>-arglen</TT> option. (Some limit is needed for efficiency to avoid reading 
  all the way to the end of the file before concluding that the match has 
  failed.) Characters are copied from the input stream into the argument value 
  until a match is found for the entire remainder of the template. Thus, when a 
  template has two or more wild card arguments, the input text is divided among 
  them as necessary for the complete template to be matched. (By contrast, a 
  ``<TT>&lt;u&gt;</TT>'' argument is similar except that it terminates when a 
  match is found for whatever sequence of literal characters follows it, up 
  until the next argument.) If the <TT>-line</TT> option is in effect or if 
  ``<TT>\L</TT>'' appeared earlier in the template, then it will not accept a 
  newline character. 
  <P>In an action, it denotes the value of the corresponding template argument. 
  </P>
  <DT><TT>?</TT>
  <DD>Wild-card argument that matches any one character. If the <TT>-line</TT> 
  option is in effect or if ``<TT>\L</TT>'' appeared earlier in the template, 
  then it will not accept a newline character. 
  <DT><TT>#</TT>
  <DD>Recursive argument. In a template, this denotes an argument whose value is 
  obtained by translating the input text in the same domain as the current rule 
  until a match is found for whatever sequence of literal characters follows the 
  argument (up to the next argument, or the end of the template, or 
  ``<TT>\G</TT>''). 
  <P>In an action, it denotes the value of the corresponding template argument. 
  </P>
  <DT><TT>&lt;</TT><I>name</I><TT>&gt;</TT>
  <DD>Recursive argument, translated according the named domain, or a 
  pre-defined recognizer argument. The name may be empty to denote the default 
  domain. The name does not have to have been defined before it is referenced. 
  This can be used only in a template. 
  <DT><TT>/</TT><I>regexp</I><TT>/</TT>
  <DD>In a template, this denotes an argument where the characters between the 
  slashes are used as a regular expression, and the argument value is however 
  much text it matches. Regular expressions have been documented many other 
  places, so will not be detailed here. Suffice it to say that the following 
  characters and combinations have special meaning:<BR><TT>. \ [ ] * + ^ $ \( \) 
  \&lt; \&gt;</TT> <BR>A slash that is to be part of the regular expression 
  needs to be preceded by a backslash. Regular expression arguments never cross 
  line boundaries. Unlike other kinds of arguments, they will match as many 
  characters as they can, without regard to whatever follows in the template. 
  For example, the template ``<TT>a/[a-z]*/x</TT>'' will never match anything 
  because if there is an ending ``<TT>x</TT>'', it will be swallowed by the 
  argument; however, in the template ``<TT>a&lt;l&gt;x</TT>'' the argument will 
  match on any letter except ``<TT>x</TT>''. 
  <DT><TT>=</TT>
  <DD>This designates the end of a template and the beginning of the 
  corresponding action. 
  <DT><TT>$0</TT>
  <DD>This can be used in an action to copy the matched text to the output. The 
  template is evaluated as though it were an action, with each argument 
  designator being replaced by the actual argument value. Note that this does 
  not necessarily exactly duplicate the input text since any ignored whitespace 
  will be lost and recursive arguments are shown in their translated form. 
  <DT><TT>$</TT><I>digit</I> or <TT>${</TT><I>digits</I><TT>}</TT>
  <DD>In either a template or action, this represents the value of the numbered 
  argument. The argument number must be enclosed in braces if it needs more than 
  one digit. In a template, this obviously can only refer to a preceding 
  argument, and in the current implementation, the value of a ``<TT>*</TT>'' 
  argument cannot be accessed within the same template. 
  <DT><TT>$</TT><I>letter</I>
  <DD>In either a template or action, this inserts the value of a variable, 
  which is limited to having a name which is a single letter. An error is 
  reported if the variable is not defined. 
  <DT><TT>${</TT><I>name</I><TT>}</TT>
  <DD>In an action, this outputs the value of variable. The name is limited to 
  not begin with a digit. An error is reported if the variable is not defined. 
  <DT><TT>${</TT><I>name</I><TT>;</TT><I>default</I><TT>}</TT>
  <DD>In an action, this outputs the value of the named variable, if it is 
  defined, or evaluates the default action if the variable is not defined. 
  <DT><TT>\ </TT>
  <DD>Escape character; see the section on ``escape sequences'' below. 
  <DT><TT>^</TT>
  <DD>Control key. Together with the following character, this represents the 
  control character formed by combining the Control key with the character. For 
  example, either ``<TT>^J</TT>'' or ``<TT>^j</TT>'' could be used to denote the 
  ASCII Line Feed character. This notation is not meaningful if a character set 
  other than ASCII is being used. 
  <DT>Space
  <DD>In a template, a space character matches one or more whitespace characters 
  in the input, the same as ``<TT>\S</TT>''. (In the less likely event that you 
  really want to match exactly one space character, you can use ``<TT>\ </TT>'' 
  or ``<TT>\s</TT>''.) In an action, a space character causes one space to be 
  output if the last character output was not a whitespace character, except 
  that if there are multiple adjacent spaces, all but the first are taken 
  literally. However, if the <TT>-w</TT> option is used, then spaces are ignored 
  except where they server to separate two identifiers. 
  <DT>NewLine
  <DD>The end of a line denotes the end of a rule or immediate action. 
  <DT><TT>;</TT>
  <DD>The semicolon is used to separate multiple rules on the same line, and to 
  separate arguments of function calls. 
  <DT><TT>@</TT><I>name</I><TT>{</TT><I>args</I><TT>}</TT>
  <DD>In an action, this notation is used to either call a built-in function or 
  to translate the argument using the rules of the named domain. The name may be 
  empty to denote the default domain. It is permissible to reference a domain 
  name that is defined later in the file. The braces may be optionally omitted 
  for functions that take no arguments. 
  <DT><TT>@</TT><I>spchar</I>
  <DD>When followed by a special character (i.e. not a letter or digit), the 
  ``<TT>@</TT>'' indicates that the following character has its default meaning, 
  as documented in this list. This can be used to access the original 
  functionality of a character that has been changed by the <TT>-literal</TT> 
  option or <TT>@set-syntax</TT> function. For example, if you had done 
  ``<TT>-literal /</TT>'' and then discovered that you do need to use a regular 
  expression, you could write it as ``<TT>@/</TT><I>regexp</I><TT>@/</TT>''. 
  <DT><TT>:</TT>
  <DD>The characters to the left of the colon (with any leading and trailing 
  spaces and surrounding angle brackets removed) constitute the name of the 
  domain in which the rules that follow on the same line will be defined. 
  <DT><TT>::</TT>
  <DD>A double colon specifies that the domain whose name appears to the left, 
  inherits from the domain whose name appears to the right. 
  <DT><TT>!</TT>
  <DD>Comment - the rest of the line is ignored. This can either appear at the 
  beginning of a line to cause the whole line to be ignored, or it can be used 
  at the end of a rule so that the remainder of the line is a comment. </DD></DL>

 The backslash character 
denotes special handling for the character that follows it. 
<UL>
  <LI>When followed by a lower-case letter or a digit, it represents a 
  particular control character. 
  <LI>When followed by an upper-case letter, it is a pattern match operator. 
  <LI>A backslash at the end of a line designates continuation by causing the 
  newline to be ignored along with any leading white space on the following 
  line. 
  <LI>Before any other character, the backslash quotes the character so that it 
  simply represents itself. In particular, a literal backslash is represented by 
  two backslashes. </LI></UL>

  <DT><TT>\b</TT>
  <DD>Backspace character 
  <DT><TT>\c</TT><I>x</I>
  <DD>Control key combined with the following character. For example, 
  ``<TT>\ci</TT>'', ``<TT>\cI</TT>'', ``<TT>^i</TT>'', ``<TT>^I</TT>'', and 
  ``<TT>\t</TT>'' all have the same effect, namely to represent the ASCII Tab 
  character. 
  <DT><TT>\d</TT>
  <DD>Delete character 
  <DT><TT>\e</TT>
  <DD>Escape character (i.e. ESC, not backslash)

  <DT><TT>\</TT><I>digits</I>
  <DD>character specified by its octal code 
  <P></P>
  <DT><TT>\A</TT>
  <DD>Matches the beginning of the input data, either the beginning of a file or 
  the beginning of the argument for a domain used as a function. 
  <DT><TT>\B</TT>
  <DD>Matches the beginning of file. This can be used either by itself to 
  specify actions to be taken before beginning to read the file, or it can be 
  used at the beginning of a template that is to match only on the first line of 
  the file. 
  <DT><TT>\C</TT>
  <DD>This causes case-insensitive comparison for letters in the rest of the 
  template. (See also the <TT>-i</TT> option which selects case-insensitive mode 
  globally.) 
  <DT><TT>\E</TT>
  <DD>Matches the end of file. 
  <DT><TT>\G</TT>
  <DD>Goal point. This can be used in a template to indicate the end of the 
  literal string that is used to recognize the end of the preceding argument. 
  For example, if the template ``<TT>a(&lt;T&gt;) done</TT>'' is applied to the 
  input data ``<TT>a(x) b(y) done</TT>'', the argument ``<TT>&lt;T&gt;</TT>'' 
  will match on the text ``<TT>x) b(y</TT>'', which is probably not what was 
  desired. If the template is written as ``<TT>a(&lt;T&gt;)\G done</TT>'' then 
  the argument will be terminated by the first right parenthesis, and then the 
  match will fail if the text following the parenthesis doesn't match ``<TT> 
  done</TT>''. This does not yet work for ``<TT>*</TT>'' arguments. 
  <P>If ``<TT>\G</TT>'' immediately follows a recursive argument, then there is 
  no delimiter, and the argument will continue to accept characters until it 
  stops itself by executing <TT>@end</TT> or <TT>@terminate</TT>. </P>
  <DT><TT>\I</TT>
  <DD>Identifier separator. In a template, this matches an empty string if it is 
  not within an identifier. In other words, it requires either of the adjacent 
  characters to not be an identifier constituent in order for the template to 
  match. In an action, this outputs a space character if the last character 
  output is an identifier constituent. By default, an identifier constituent is 
  a letter, digit, or underscore, but this can be extended by the 
  <TT>-idchars</TT> option. 
  <DT><TT>\J</TT>
  <DD>Join - locally counteracts the <TT>-w</TT> and/or <TT>-t</TT> option by 
  saying that spaces in the input will not be ignored at this position, and an 
  identifier delimiter is not required here. If neither of these options is 
  being used, then it has no effect. Not meaningful in an action. 
  <DT><TT>\L</TT>
  <DD>Line mode - arguments that follow in the same template are not allowed to 
  cross line boundaries. This also means that ``<TT>\S</TT>'' and 
  ``<TT>\W</TT>'' will not accept newline characters. However, a line boundary 
  can still be crossed by an explicit ``<TT>\n</TT>'' or ``<TT>\N</TT>''. 
  <DT><TT>\N</TT>
  <DD>New line boundary. In a template, this matches an empty string if it is at 
  either the beginning of a line or the end of a line (either before or after a 
  new line character, or at the beginning or end of the file or data stream). In 
  an action, it outputs a new line character if the last character output is not 
  a new line. 
  <DT><TT>\P</TT>
  <DD>Position - if the template matches, the input stream will be left at this 
  position. Thus everything following this is a look-ahead, and will be re-read 
  for subsequent pattern matches. 
  <DT><TT>\S</TT>
  <DD>Space. In a template, this matches one or more whitespace characters. (See 
  also ``<TT>&lt;S&gt;</TT>'' which has the same effect except that the spaces 
  are remembered as an argument value.) In an action, it outputs one space 
  character if the last character output is not a whitespace character. 
  <DT><TT>\W</TT>
  <DD>Optional whitespace. In a template, this specifies that any whitespace 
  characters in the input stream at this point will be skipped over. (See also 
  ``<TT>&lt;s&gt;</TT>'' which has the same effect except that the spaces are 
  remembered as an argument value.) However, if this is followed in the template 
  by a literal whitespace character, then that character will not be skipped. 
  For example, in ``<TT>\W\n</TT>'', the ``<TT>\W</TT>'' will skip any 
  whitespace other than a newline. This has no effect in an action. See also the 
  <TT>-w</TT> option which ignores spaces everywhere. 
  <DT><TT>\X</TT>
  <DD>Word separator. In a template, this matches an empty string if it is not 
  within a word. In this context, a word consists of letters and digits. 
  <DT><TT>\Z</TT>
  <DD>Matches the end of the input data, either the end of a file or the end of 
  the argument for a domain used as a function, or a look-ahead match of the 
  terminating string for a recursive argument. </DD></DL>

 The following argument 
designators, consisting of a single letter between angle brackets, can be used 
in templates to match on various kinds of characters. Preceding the letter with 
``<TT>-</TT>'' inverts the test. The argument requires at least one matching 
character if the letter is uppercase, or is optional if the letter is lowercase. 
The letter may be followed by a number to match on that many characters, or up 
to that maximum for an optional argument. If the number is <TT>0</TT>, the 
argument matches if the next character is of the indicated kind, but the input 
stream is not advanced past it; in other words, this acts as a one-character 
look-ahead. 
<P>If the argument is followed in the template by literal characters, then the 
argument will be terminated when that literal string is matched, even if those 
characters would otherwise qualify for inclusion in the argument.
