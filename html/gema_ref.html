<P>This document is the user manual for <B>gema</B>, a program whose name stands 
for <B>ge</B>neral purpose <B>ma</B>cro processor. This is a utility program 
which is run as a shell command under Unix or MS-DOS and can be used for 
performing conversions or translations of data files or extracting information 
from files. 
<P>The <TT>man</TT> page for <B>gema</B> provides a tutorial introduction and a 
brief reference summary, while this document provides a more detailed 
specification. It would probably be best to read the tutorial section first 
before reading the rest of this document. The command line options are fully 
documented in the <TT>man</TT> page, so will not be repeated here. 
<P>This version of the document corresponds to version 1.2 of the program. (Note 
that the <TT>-version</TT> option can be used to check which version you are 
running.)
<p align="right"> <a href="#1Intrd" classe="ssm">up</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><A name="2OprtOvrv">2</A> Operational Overview&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <a href="#1Intrd" class="ssm"><font size="-1">prev</font></a>
 <a href="#toc" class="ssm"><font size="-1">toc</font></a>
 <a href="notation.html#3Ntt" class="ssm"><font size="-1">next</font></a></h2>
<P>The general model of operation is that the program reads an input file and 
writes an output file which consists of the input data transformed in accordance 
with a set of transformation rules provided by the user. A rule consists of a 
<EM>template</EM> and an <EM>action</EM>. The template is a pattern which the 
program will attempt to match with the input data. Any input text that matches a 
template pattern will be replaced by the result of evaluating the rule's action. 
There may be multiple sets of rules, where each set of rules is called a 
<EM>domain</EM>. At any given time, translation is controlled by the rules of 
one particular domain, but both templates and actions are able to switch to a 
different domain for processing particular portions of the data. A domain can 
inherit from another domain, meaning that if no match is found for the current 
input text in any of the rules for the current domain, then the rules of the 
inherited domain will be tried. 
<P>Processing of a file begins using the default domain, whose name is the empty 
string. First, if there is a rule with template ``<TT>\B</TT>'' (beginning of 
file) or ``<TT>\A</TT>'' (beginning of data), then its action is performed. Then 
the program begins reading the file. For each character position in the file, 
the program attempts to find a rule in the current domain whose template pattern 
matches the input text beginning at that point. If a match is found, then the 
input stream is advanced to the end of the matched text and the rule's action is 
executed. When no template matches the current position, the current character 
is copied to the output file (unless the <TT>-match</TT> option is being used), 
the input stream is advanced to the next character, and it tries to find a 
template matching the text starting at that position. When the end of the input 
file is reached, if there are any rules with template ``<TT>\E</TT>'' (end of 
file) or ``<TT>\Z</TT>'' (end of data), their actions will be executed, and then 
the files will be closed. 
<P>However, if a template matches without advancing the input stream (for 
example, if it begins with ``<TT>\P</TT>''), then after executing its action, 
the search continues as though it had not matched. This is necessary to avoid 
hanging in a loop repeating the same match forever. 
<P>A rule may have an empty action, with the effect that the matching text is 
simply discarded. In each domain there may be at most one rule with an empty 
template, which signifies a default action to be taken when no other rule 
matches. However, since an empty template does not cause the input stream to be 
advanced and there are no more rules to try, this is only meaningful if the 
corresponding action exits the current context by using one of <TT>@end</TT>, 
<TT>@terminate</TT>, <TT>@fail</TT>, or <TT>@abort</TT>. 
<P>Generally speaking, while looking for a match, the rules within a domain will 
conceptually be tried in the same order in which they were defined, so wherever 
there might be ambiguities, the user should define the rules for preferred 
special cases before the rules for default general cases. However, there are 
some important exceptions: 
<UL>
  <LI>Rules beginning with a literal character (including space or 
  ``<TT>\S</TT>'') will be tried before rules beginning with an argument. 
  (Operators that don't advance the input stream, such as ``<TT>\N</TT>'', 
  ``<TT>\I</TT>'', or ``<TT>\L</TT>'', are ignored for the purpose of this 
  determination.) The way this actually works is that the current input 
  character is used as an array index to find the list of rules beginning with 
  that character. If none are found, or none match, then the rules beginning 
  with arguments are tried in sequence. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>If two rules begin with the same sequence of literal characters, the one 
  with the longer literal string will be tried first. This is because if this 
  were not done, a more specific rule appearing later would never match, which 
  would surely not be what the user intended. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>If two rules have identical templates, the second rule will replace the 
  first on the assumption that it is a redefinition.[<a name="fn1_b" href="#FN1">Footnote 1</a>]
   </LI></UL>
<P>Rules can be defined either as arguments of the <TT>-p</TT> command line 
option or in pattern files loaded by the <TT>-f</TT> option. Each line in a 
pattern file can be one of the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>A comment line, indicated by a ``<TT>!</TT>'' in the first column. 
  <LI>Any blank lines are ignored. 
  <LI>An immediate action - a line beginning with ``<TT>@</TT>'' can contain one 
  or more function calls which will be evaluated immediately before reading the 
  next line. Normally these should be functions that are used for their side 
  effects and do not return a value. The most common case is using 
  ``<TT>@set</TT>'' to initialize a variable. 
  <LI>Any other line is expected to be a rule, which should contain a 
  ``<TT>=</TT>'' separating the template and action. A line may contain multiple 
  rules, separated by semicolons. A rule may be continued on another line by 
  ending the line with a backslash, which causes the following newline to be 
  ignored and skips over any leading spaces on the following line. 
  <P>Rules may be preceded by a domain name followed by a colon, which causes 
  all of the rules following on the same line to be defined in the designated 
  domain. The domain name may optionally be enclosed in angle brackets, and any 
  leading or trailing blanks will be ignored. If the domain is to be referenced 
  in an action following ``<TT>@</TT>'', then the name should be limited to 
  letters, digits, hyphen, and underscore. </P>
  <LI>A line of the form ``<EM>name1</EM><TT>::</TT><EM>name2</EM>'' specifies 
  that the domain named on the left inherits from the domain named on the right. 
  Each domain can inherit from at most one other, but multiple levels of 
  inheritance is allowed. </LI></UL>
<P>A template may contain any of the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Literal characters, which are to be exactly matched. Literal characters 
  include letters, digits, special characters quoted by a backslash, control 
  characters designated by backslash followed by a lower case letter or digit, 
  control characters designated by ``<TT>^</TT>'' followed by a letter, and any 
  other characters that don't have any special meaning. Any of the 256 possible 
  characters can be used. 
  <LI>Arguments, which match some variable portion of text, and remember the 
  matched text so that it can be referenced later. There are several different 
  kinds of arguments, which are denoted by ``<TT>*</TT>'', ``<TT>?</TT>'', 
  ``<TT>#</TT>'', ``<TT>&lt;</TT><EM>...</EM><TT>&gt;</TT>''. and 
  ``<TT>/</TT><EM>...</EM><TT>/</TT>''. The current implementation allows a 
  template to have a maximum of twenty arguments. 
  <LI>Template operators, denoted by a backslash followed by an upper case 
  letter, or by the space character. These may set local options, impose 
  additional requirements for a match, or allow skipping of redundant spaces in 
  the input. 
  <LI>A dollar sign may be used followed by a single letter or digit to insert 
  the value of a variable or a previous argument into the text that is to be 
  matched. (This does not currently work for ``<TT>*</TT>'' arguments.) </LI></UL>
<P>An action may contain any of the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Literal characters, which when evaluated simply copy themselves to the 
  output stream. 
  <LI>The value of a template argument can be output by using a dollar sign 
  followed by the argument number (enclosed in braces if more than one digit), 
  or by using the characters ``<TT>*</TT>'', ``<TT>?</TT>'', or ``<TT>#</TT>'' 
  to denote the corresponding argument. 
  <LI>The notation ``<TT>${</TT><EM>name</EM><TT>}</TT>'' can be used to output 
  the value of a variable. 
  <LI>The notation ``<TT>@</TT><EM>name</EM><TT>{</TT><EM>args</EM><TT>}</TT>'' 
  can be used to call a built-in function or to translate the argument with a 
  user-defined domain. 
  <LI>Some of the operators denoted by a space or backslash followed by an upper 
  case letter also apply in actions, typically for conditional output of spaces 
  or newlines. </LI></UL><br>
